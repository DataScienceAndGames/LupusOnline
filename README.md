Tools to automatize some random elements of board games.
For now it only has a randomizer for the roles of Mafia-like games.
To use it, put the name of on player per line in the "players.txt" file
and the names of one role per line in the "roles.txt" file.
Then run "lupus.py" and one file per player will be created, containing their role.
This way whoever runs the program can send the role to the other players without
looking at it.

The name comes from a variant of the party game "Mafia".
